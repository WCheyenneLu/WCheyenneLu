## Web Design/ Development Projects
- [2025: Humming Bird] (https://github.com/WCheyenneLu/HummingBird): Inspired by Shazam, I built HummingBird, a Python project that, in real time, listens to a short hummed melody, extracts frequency features with librosa, aligns them via dynamic time warping, and returns the top match.
- [2024: Jumpway.co.ltd. Website Version 2](https://github.com/WCheyenneLu/jumpwayv2): Due to lack of fluency, bugs, and small layout issues, I recreated the company website from last year using Figma for design and React JS to develop the website into an single-paged application. 
- [2023: Jumpway.co.ltd Website Version 1](http://jumpway.co.th/): Researched about company's values, their colors, took photos etc. Designed and developed the company website using Adobe XD, HTML, CSS, and JS. Reached out to the company after final results, they immediately adopted it as their new page and even helped them connect through to new clients. 
- [2021-2022: TeenPainConnect SEO Developement (Wix)](https://ceni23.wixsite.com/teenpainconnect) Created an interactive website with functioning forum, educational resources and other features for chronic pain patients, especially in the youth, to hear stories of other chronic patients suffering in isolation. Developed SEO using Wix Analytics to help website reach audiences from 30+ countries around the world including Autralia, Singapore, Poland, and many more.  
- [2020: EV3 Website Design](https://github.com/WCheyenneLu/EV3): Comission design and basic HTML and CSS project in October 2021 during COVID for a student who was passionate about and interested in creating a EV3 Robotics Tutorial Website for young children to learn and be exposed to hardware programming from a young age. My responsibilities included all levels of design including pageflow, colors, fonts, etc.
