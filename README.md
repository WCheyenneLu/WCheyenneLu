## Web Design/ Development Projects
- [2025: Internship]
- [2025: Humming Bird] (https://github.com/WCheyenneLu/HummingBird): Inspired by Shazam, I built HummingBird, a Python project that, in real time, listens to a short hummed melody, extracts frequency features with librosa, aligns them via dynamic time warping, and returns the top match.
- [2024: TASA Sorting Algorithm]: Automated member-matching algorithm in Python (Pandas, regex) that clusters 200+ users into balanced groups using weighted lexical-similarity scoring and constraint optimization.
- [2023/24: Jumpway.co.ltd. Website](https://github.com/WCheyenneLu/jumpwayv2):
