<!--- ## Web Design/ Development Projects
- [2025: Syscom Internship](https://github.com/WCheyenneLu/WCheyenneLu/tree/main/software-engineering/syscom): Front-end engineering internship using Vue.js (Vite, Pinia, Vuetify) to turn a survey platform into a course system. 
- [2025: Humming Bird](https://github.com/WCheyenneLu/WCheyenneLu/tree/main/data-science/hummingbird): Inspired by Shazam, I built HummingBird, a Python project that, in real time, listens to a short hummed melody, extracts frequency features with librosa, aligns them via dynamic time warping, and returns the top match.
- [2024: TASA Sorting Algorithm](https://github.com/WCheyenneLu/WCheyenneLu/tree/main/data-science/tasa-sorting-algorithm): Automated member-matching algorithm in Python (Pandas, regex) that clusters 200+ users into balanced groups using weighted lexical-similarity scoring and constraint optimization.
- [2024: Jumpway.co.ltd. Website](https://github.com/WCheyenneLu/WCheyenneLu/tree/main/software-engineering/jumpway): Redesigned (Figma) and developed (React, JS, CSS) company website to provide clear branding and an increase in inbound client requests
