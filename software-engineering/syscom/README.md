### Tech Stack

### Project Overview

This project was part of my software developer internship at The Syscom Group (Taipei, Taiwan). I led front-end migration efforts to transition a survey-based system into a full-featured course platform serving 20K+ users across 22 Taiwan counties. The goal was to enhance scalability, analytics, and usability for multiple government and non-profit clients running training programs and feedback assessments.

### Key Results

- Expanded access to 20K+ users across 22 counties
- Automated data analytics, eliminating manual CSV processing for 10K+ survey records
- Improved content deployment speed with standardized authoring workflows
- Delivered 100% of front-end tasks on time, coordinating daily with PM and client executives
